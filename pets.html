                    <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                        different
                        beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                        long as
                        he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                        wanting to
                        admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                    <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of
                        his
                        energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                        toys "a
                        ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken
                        to the
                        Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a
                        special
                        personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the
                        window to
                        keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from
                        the
                        mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
                    <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of
                        the day is
                        his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves
                        his toy
                        duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get
                        some
                        practice with his toy duck.</p>

                    <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his
                        days
                        lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to
                        make
                        friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see a cyclist, but he is not
                        allowed to
                        give chase.</p>
                    <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold
                        weather. He
                        would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</p>
